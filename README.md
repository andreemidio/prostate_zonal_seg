# prostate zonal segmentation
1. This is a deep learning-based algorithm for the prostate zonal segmentations (for the paper: "Automatic Prostate Zonal Segmentation Using Fully Convolutional Network With Feature Pyramid Attention" - https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8894451)

2. 200 patients' MRI (axial view; from ProstateX Datasets (https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/SPIE-AAPM-NCI+PROSTATEx+Challenges#23691656b8a499cbc0a24a56b7ea0a7422d51994)) and the prostate zonal segmentation annotations were uploaded. 

3. label 1 and 2 in the mask indicates the pheripheral and transitional zones, respectively. Their boundaries were enclosed by 255. 

4. Feel free to use the prostate zonal annotations. If you have any question, please email me (liuyongkai1009@g.ucla.edu)
