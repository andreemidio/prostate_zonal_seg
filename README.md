1. This is a deel-learning based algorithm for the prostate zonal segmentations (Automatic Prostate Zonal Segmentation Using Fully Convolutional Network With Feature Pyramid Attention). - https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8894451

2. 200 patients' MRI (axial view; from ProstateX Datasets) and the prostate zonal segmentation annotations were already uploaded. 

3. Feel free to use the prostate zonal annotations. 

4. Attribution should include references to the following citations:

Y. Liu et al., "Automatic Prostate Zonal Segmentation Using Fully Convolutional Network With Feature Pyramid Attention," in IEEE Access, vol. 7, pp. 163626-163632, 2019, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2952534.

Since the public dataset was from ProstateX, you should cite their paper.
